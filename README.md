# All About the Violin
The violin is a string instrument made of wood that usually comes in 3 sizes. 1/2 size, 3/4 size, and full size or 4/4 size. When your student is stil very young, you may be able to find smaller sizes, but these are the standard sizes that violin players use. The violin has 4 strings, the **g-string**, the **d-string**, the **a-string**, and the **e-string**, with the g-string being the lowest and the e-string being the highest.

## Sound
The violin has a higher range and should not be mistaken for a Viola, wich has a much lower range and is slightly bigger in size. Violin's are very beautiful sounding and are played through placing fingers (the index, middle, ring, and pinkie) on the *fingerboard* and bow strokes in the area between the *end of the fingerboard* and the *bridge* (see below to see the different parts)

## Other
Some people consider the violin the "flute of the strings". It is one of the more popular string instruments and requires a lot of practice for techniques such as shifting, vibrato, double-stops, triple-stops, and much more.
